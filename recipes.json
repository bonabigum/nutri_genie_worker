Continue to boil, stirring occasionally, until oil begins to separate from the milk, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium. Continue to cook, scraping the bottom of the skillet regularly with a heatproof spatula until only golden brown residue and oil is left, about 15 minutes. It will look a bit like ground meat, this is normal. Strain mixture to separate coconut solids from the oil. The coconut solids are the latik and will be served with the pudding. Reserve the oil for another use. Cover and chill the latik until serving time. Line an 8-inch square baking pan with parchment paper, extending the paper up two sides of the pan. Set aside. To make the pudding: Whisk sugar and cornstarch together in a medium saucepan. Stir in coconut cream, cream-style corn, and corn kernels, if using. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring constantly, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium. Continue to cook and stir until mixture is thick and bubbly, 2 minutes. Pour corn mixture into the prepared pan. Cover and refrigerate until chilled, at least 2 hours or up to 24 hours before serving. Invert pudding carefully onto a serving plate. Remove parchment and discard. Cut into 12 slices. Remove latik from the refrigerator. Chop finely, if desired. Sprinkle latik over each slice. "],
